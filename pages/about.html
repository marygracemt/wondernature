				wonderNATURE has observed the Earth's situation regarding climate change 
				and how scientists protested about this matter. With our situation, 
				this organization wanted to be a voice for the people. By creating this website, 
				it would help humans to be educated, especially now that we have advanced technology. 
				With the importance our nature brings to our everyday lives, we want to help by 
				conserving it for everyone's benefit as we aim for the best future.
