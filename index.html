			<p class = "hometext5"> 
				Nature is a very important aspect of our lives as we live in the world for free—free air, 
				land, water, soil, and many more. Without nature, we wouldn't live as it is our source for 
				getting water, producing food and medicine, and we rely on it on a day-to-day basis. 
				However, a lack of conservation support or action on this matter will harm our planet. 
				And that is why action starts now for nature to heal and for it to continue sustaining us in the future.

			<p class = "hometext7"> 
				Land conservation is one of the things that we must focus on, 
				especially since we humans live here. When we take action regarding this matter, 
				we can: preserve our land for future generations; protect our supplies; purify our air; 
				protect wildlife; and live a happy life. Our resources on land are limited, 
				which is why we must act as quickly as possible.

				Water is a renewable resource. However, water is unavailable for human use since 2.5 percent 
				is freshwater. We may have water right now, but in some places, people suffer from water shortages. 
				Remember that polluted water affects all of us because we use nature like a cycle. 
				With this matter, we must prevent wasting and polluting water as it affects us humans and marine life.

				We must not forget how we use nature in our daily lives. 
				Living things use nature in a CYCLE. In present times, 
				we are facing climate change due to inhuman actions. 
				In order to stop and prevent the effects of our carelessness, 
				we should take action in all the best ways that we can. Instilling this in our minds starts now!
