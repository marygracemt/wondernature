				Nature is a very important aspect of our lives as we live in the world for freeâ€”free air, 
				land, water, soil, and many more. Without nature, we wouldn't live as it is our source for 
				getting water, producing food and medicine, and we rely on it on a day-to-day basis. 
				However, a lack of conservation support or action on this matter will harm our planet. 
				And that is why action starts now for nature to heal and for it to continue sustaining us in the future.
